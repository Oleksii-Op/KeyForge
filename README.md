### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance Python web framework
- **OpenTelemetry**: Application observability framework for monitoring and tracing

### Reverse proxy
- **Nginx**: A web server that serves frontend static assets while 
acting as a reverse proxy and load balancer (Round-Robin). It also 
integrates the OpenTelemetry module for request tracing and monitoring.

### Observability
- **Prometheus**: A powerful metrics collection and monitoring system used to
scrape and store backend and infrastructure metrics.
- **Grafana**: A visualization and analytics platform that
provides dashboards to monitor application performance, infrastructure, and logs.
- **Loki**: A log aggregation system that efficiently collects 
and indexes logs from different components without requiring full indexing.
- **Tempo**: A distributed tracing system that enables end-to-end
request tracking across services, providing insights into request latencies and dependencies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

1. The React frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with cryptographic tools
2. API requests are sent to the FastAPI backend for processing
3. The backend performs the actual cryptographic operations and returns results
4. Results are displayed to users through a clean, responsive interface

With Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and Prometheus integrated, the application achieves full observability by covering:

- **Metrics (Prometheus + Grafana Dashboards)**
- **Logs (Loki + Grafana Dashboards)**
- **Traces (Tempo + Grafana Dashboards)**

This ensures better performance monitoring, issue detection, and debugging capabilities in a single observability platform. üöÄ

## üîç Security Considerations

- **Ephemeral Processing**: Data is processed and immediately discarded after returning results
- **No Data Collection**: The application doesn't track, store, or analyze user data
- **Client-Side Security**: Sensitive data is not stored in browser storage
- **Strong Defaults**: Conservative default parameters for cryptographic operations

## üöÄ Getting Started

> [!Note]
> All the passwords and keys are fake and are not used anywhere.
> Consider creating your own self-signed SSL certs and secrets
```shell
# For Nginx
1. openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
2. openssl req -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365
3. openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048

# Do steps 1 and 2 for Grafana 
```


1. [Loki Docker Driver](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/docker-driver/) is required.
   ```shell
   docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:2.9.2 --alias loki --grant-all-permissions
   ```
2. Create .env files for backend and frontend and docker compose
  Those are required and will be overwritten by docker-compose env variables.
  ```shell
  /KeyForge/application$ cp .env.template .env
  cd ../frontend
  /KeyForge/frontend$ cp .env.template .env
  cd ..
  /KeyForge/$ cp .env.template .env
  ```

3. Verify .env file in the root directory for docker-compose.yaml
```shell
# APP COMMON
PROJECT_NAME=KeyForge
COLLECTOR_HOST=http://tempo
COLLECTOR_PORT=4317
FRONTEND_HOST=https://reverse-proxy/
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=http://prometheus/
HEALTH_CHECK_ENDPOINT=wget --no-verbose --tries=1 -O /dev/null http://127.0.0.1:8000/utils/health-check || exit 1

# Backend 1
# service name is hardcoded in nginx.conf and grafana dashboards
# change these above if the service name is to be changed
SERVICE_NAME_1=app-a
REPLICA_ID_1=1

# Backend 2
# service name is hardcoded in nginx.conf and grafana dashboards
# change these above if the service name is to be changed
SERVICE_NAME_2=app-b
REPLICA_ID_2=2
```

4. Run the services
  ```shell
  docker compose up -d  
  ```
5. View the main page [https://localhost/](https://localhost/)
> [!NOTE]
> Your browser may complain about self-signed certificate, just accept.

6. Log into Grafana [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/)
```shell
username: admin
password: qwerty
```
> [!NOTE]
> Your browser may complain about self-signed certificate, just accept.

## Load Testing and Performance Issues with FastAPI and RSA Key Generation

### Overview
During load testing, a performance issue was identified in a FastAPI-based
backend running behind an NGINX reverse proxy with round-robin load balancing.
The backend consists of two Docker containers, each running four Uvicorn workers.

A Bash script simulates high-load scenarios by sending asynchronous API requests,
including computationally expensive RSA key generation (up to 8192-bit keys).
Under extreme conditions, this heavy load causes the backends to crash.

### Consequences?

Potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.

### Possible Solutions

1. Rate Limiting
Implement fastapi-limiter to restrict access to resource-intensive endpoints.
This can mitigate DoS attacks but is ineffective against DDoS.

2. Worker Scaling
Increase backend replicas or Uvicorn workers to distribute the load.
While this improves capacity, it does not eliminate the computational bottleneck.

3. Offloading RSA Generation to AWS Lambda
Move RSA key generation to an AWS Lambda function, offloading 
the computational workload to a scalable cloud service.
This is one of the best solutions.

4. Pre-Generated Keys in Redis
Create a separate backend that pre-generates and stores RSA keys in Redis.
This reduces real-time computation but is ineffective if a user requires password-based encryption.

### Conclusion
The best approach is to offload RSA key generation to a scalable 
cloud function like AWS Lambda while maintaining monitoring and tracing for improved observability.
