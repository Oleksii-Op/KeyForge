## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Modern UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better reliability
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for custom designs
- **Shadcn UI**: High-quality UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth, performant transitions
- **React Query**: Data fetching and state management library
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for single-page applications

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance Python web framework
- **OpenTelemetry**: Application observability framework for monitoring and tracing
- **Cryptographic Libraries**:
  - **cryptography**: For RSA and ED25519 key generation and handling
  - **argon2-cffi**: For Argon2 password hashing
  - **bcrypt**: For Bcrypt password hashing
  - **hashlib**: For general-purpose hashing functions

### Reverse proxy
- **Nginx**: A web server that serves frontend static assets while 
acting as a reverse proxy and load balancer (Round-Robin). It also 
integrates the OpenTelemetry module for request tracing and monitoring.

### Observability
- **Prometheus**: A powerful metrics collection and monitoring system used to
scrape and store backend and infrastructure metrics.
- **Grafana**: A visualization and analytics platform that
provides dashboards to monitor application performance, infrastructure, and logs.
- **Loki**: A log aggregation system that efficiently collects 
and indexes logs from different components without requiring full indexing.
- **Tempo**: A distributed tracing system that enables end-to-end
request tracking across services, providing insights into request latencies and dependencies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

1. The React frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with cryptographic tools
2. API requests are sent to the FastAPI backend for processing
3. The backend performs the actual cryptographic operations and returns results
4. Results are displayed to users through a clean, responsive interface

With Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and Prometheus integrated, the application achieves full observability by covering:

- **Metrics (Prometheus + Grafana Dashboards)**
- **Logs (Loki + Grafana Dashboards)**
- **Traces (Tempo + Grafana Dashboards)**

This ensures better performance monitoring, issue detection, and debugging capabilities in a single observability platform. üöÄ

## üîç Security Considerations

- **Ephemeral Processing**: Data is processed and immediately discarded after returning results
- **No Data Collection**: The application doesn't track, store, or analyze user data
- **Client-Side Security**: Sensitive data is not stored in browser storage
- **Strong Defaults**: Conservative default parameters for cryptographic operations

## üöÄ Getting Started

> [!Note]
> All the passwords and keys are fake and are not used anywhere.
> Consider creating your own self-signed SSL certs and secrets
```shell
# For Nginx
1. openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
2. openssl req -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365
3. openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048

# Do steps 1 and 2 for Grafana 
```


1. [Loki Docker Driver](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/docker-driver/) is required.
   ```shell
   docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:2.9.2 --alias loki --grant-all-permissions
   ```
2. Create .env files for backend and frontend and docker compose
  Those are required and will be overwritten by docker-compose env variables.
  ```shell
  /KeyForge/application$ cp .env.template .env
  cd ../frontend
  /KeyForge/frontend$ cp .env.template .env
  cd ..
  /KeyForge/$ cp .env.template .env
  ```

3. Verify .env file in the root directory for docker-compose.yaml
```shell
# APP COMMON
PROJECT_NAME=KeyForge
COLLECTOR_HOST=http://tempo
COLLECTOR_PORT=4317
FRONTEND_HOST=https://reverse-proxy/
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=http://prometheus/
HEALTH_CHECK_ENDPOINT=wget --no-verbose --tries=1 -O /dev/null http://127.0.0.1:8000/utils/health-check || exit 1

# Backend 1
# service name is hardcoded in nginx.conf and grafana dashboards
# change these above if the service name is to be changed
SERVICE_NAME_1=app-a
REPLICA_ID_1=1

# Backend 2
# service name is hardcoded in nginx.conf and grafana dashboards
# change these above if the service name is to be changed
SERVICE_NAME_2=app-b
REPLICA_ID_2=2
```

4. Run the services
  ```shell
  docker compose up -d  
  ```
5. View the main page [https://localhost/](https://localhost/)
> [!NOTE]
> Your browser may complain about self-signed certificate, just accept.

6. Log into Grafana [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/)
```shell
username: admin
password: qwerty
```
> [!NOTE]
> Your browser may complain about self-signed certificate, just accept.

## üìä Load Testing and Performance Optimization

### Performance Issues Identified
During extensive load testing, performance bottlenecks were identified
in the FastAPI backend, particularly with computationally intensive operations like RSA key generation.

#### Test Environment
- Backend: FastAPI with 4 Uvicorn workers per container
- Deployment: Docker containers behind NGINX reverse proxy
- Load Balancing: Round-robin strategy
- Testing: Concurrent API requests using bash script simulating high user demand

#### Key Issue
Under high load, especially with requests for 8192-bit RSA key generation,
the backend exhibited significant strain, sometimes leading to service degradation or failure.

|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **API Rate Limiting** | `fastapi-limiter` with Redis                             | Prevents resource exhaustion, but useless in case of DDoS           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Worker Scaling** | Optimized Uvicorn workers or increase container replicas | Improved request handling                                           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Lambda Offloading** | AWS Lambda for key generation                            | Isolated resource-intensive operations                              | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Key Caching** | Redis-based key pre-generation                           | Reduced computation overhead, but useless if a user uses a password | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

</div>

### Conclusion
The best approach is to offload RSA key generation to a scalable 
cloud function like AWS Lambda while maintaining monitoring and 
tracing for improved observability.
